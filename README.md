# JavaFXMinesSweeper
My version of MinesSweeper Game

Final Version 1.0

msi Installer for Windows and .jar file available in folder  "out/artifacts/JavaFXMinesSweeper_jar"

The rules of the game are the same of the old MineSweeper game that we all enjoyed from Microsoft games. The only difference is the JavaFX UI.
