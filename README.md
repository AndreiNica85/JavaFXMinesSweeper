# JavaFXMinesSweeper
My version of MinesSweeper Game

Final Version 1.0

If you want to check out the code and try it in Console in IDE you need javaFX SDK 19 installed. Just add the library in your IDE and add the javafx SDK 19 modules to your project. You may use Java JDK 17 or higher.

If you just want to have fun and play just install it with .msi Installer for Windows available in folder  "out/artifacts/JavaFXMinesSweeper_jar"

Install it in any folder but not in "\Program Files" because of folder write/read permissions issues.

The rules of the game are the same of the old MineSweeper game that we all enjoyed from Microsoft games. The only difference is the JavaFX UI.

Have fun and Enjoy!
